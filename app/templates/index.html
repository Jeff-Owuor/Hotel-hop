                <p>2022/07/16 7.30</p>
                <p>The best hotel I<q></q>ve ever been privileged enough to stay at. Gorgeous building, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in. High quality rooms (there was even a tv by the shower), and high quality service. Also, they are one of few hotels that allow people under 21 to book a reservation.</p>

                <h4>Odoi Ibrahim</h4>
                <p>2022/07/16 12.30</p>
                <p> They were extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in early at like 10am. We got to hotel super early and I didnâ€™t wanna wait. So this was a big plus. The sevice was exceptional as well. Would definitely send a friend there</p>

                <p>2022/07/16 4.30</p>
                <p> The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Nairobi</p>
